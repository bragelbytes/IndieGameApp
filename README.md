# indiegameapp

On this app the structure of the API was going to make it difficult to implement my original idea for a carousel. I decided to run a for loop to just see what it would look like to display all the game's images on the screen and, with a little styling, decided I liked how they looked similar to "cards". I knew from there I wanted to style some cards with the images and titles the API was giving me then have them open up into a modal that displays things like average critic ratings, how long to beat, screenshots etc. It was a lot of fun seeing my ideas (like animating the cards and making them look 3 dimensional) come to life via jQuery. I do wish this API gave a summary of each game because I think it could really help someone find their next indie game to check out! I'd like to come back and implement a sort of "library" system so the user can create a list of cards that represent what they may want to check out next.
