# IndieGameApp

This is a web app project created for my General Assembly Software Engineering class.
It displays the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and API calls to display various video game related cards. 

Click on the cards to display more information about each game like screenshots, how long to beat, average ratings, etc.
